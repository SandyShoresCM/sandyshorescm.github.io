      </nav>


      <div class="container">
        <h2 class="first-paragraph"> Shoreline erosion is the loss of land and the weathering of coastal rock that is
          caused by high water levels and strong storm waves. From the 40s to 60s, storms had heavily eroded Deerfield
          Beach and other beaches on the Atlantic coast.</h2>

        </div>
        <h2 class="second-paragraph">Shoreline Erosion is responsible for 500 million dollars in property loss and
          damages
          each year. It also heavily impacts fishing, agriculture, and tourism. Not protecting our shoreline can lead
          to
          even more disastrous events especially during weather emergencies.</h2>

          Groins
        </h1>
        <div class="left">
          <h2 class="groins" style="max-width: 50%;">Groins are perpendicular structures that interrupt water flow and
            limit
            the movement of
            sediment and allow for
            the build up of sand.</h2>

        <div class="right">
          <img src="images/jetties.png" class="jetty">
          <h2 class="jetties" style="max-width: 50%;">Jetties are structures that protect costlines from tides and
            currents
            serving as a barrier from
            erosion as well as connection the sea where people can fish safely.</h2>

        <h1 class="title">Other Solutions</h1>
        <h2 class="second-paragraph">Although the aforementioned structures alleviate the stress of erosion in the
          short
          run, in the long run they are proven to continue the process of erosion. Serving as only temporary solutions
          to
          this seemingly permanent problem.</h2>
        <h1 class="groins" style="text-decoration-line: underline; margin-top: 3rem;">Dunes and Vegetation</h1>
        <h2 class="groins" style='max-width: 100%;'>Dunes serve as natural protection for coastlines as well as provide
          homes for native animals and plants. As plants grow on dunes they anchor sand in place further preventing
          erosion. In our town, Deerfield Beach, and the neighboring town, Pompano Beach, there are many dune projects
          as shown below.</h2>
